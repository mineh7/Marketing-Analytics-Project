# Churn Drivers

## Key Churn Drivers
Churn drivers are behaviors or actions that increase the likelihood of a customer leaving. In this project, we identified the following key drivers:

---

### 1. **Low Usage**
- **Definition**: Customers with **usage frequency < 5** are considered "low users" and are flagged as at risk of churning.
- **Reason**: If a customer is not actively using the product, they are less likely to renew their subscription.
- **How to Address**: 
  - Send usage reminders or feature tutorials.
  - Trigger automated emails encouraging customers to use underutilized features.

---

### 2. **Negative Feedback**
- **Definition**: Customers who give a feedback rating of **less than 3** on a 5-point scale are considered dissatisfied.
- **Reason**: Poor experiences or dissatisfaction with a product or service leads to churn.
- **How to Address**: 
  - Address feedback with personalized customer support.
  - Prioritize resolving issues highlighted in feedback.

### 3. **No Transaction History**
- **Definition**: Customers who have not made any transactions within a certain period.
- **Reason**: No payment activity often indicates disinterest or disengagement.
- **How to Address**: 
  - Offer time-limited promotions or discounts.
  - Use reminder emails for payment deadlines or plan renewals.
