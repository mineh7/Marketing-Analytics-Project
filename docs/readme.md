**Customer Retention: Reducing Churn in Subscription-Based Businesses**

## Overview  
High churn rates within the first three months pose a significant challenge for subscription-based businesses. This project focuses on identifying the key drivers of churn, leveraging data analytics to predict customer behavior, and implementing actionable strategies to enhance customer retention. By reducing churn, businesses can achieve sustainable growth, improve customer loyalty, and maximize profitability.

## Problem Statement  
Subscription-based businesses often lose a significant number of customers within the initial months. This leads to:  
- Loss of potential long-term revenue.  
- Increased costs for acquiring new customers.  
- Reduced brand loyalty.  

The challenge is to understand **why customers churn** and implement data-driven strategies to **reduce churn rates effectively**.

## Project Objectives  
1. **Identify churn drivers**: Analyze customer demographics, usage behavior, payment history, and feedback to determine factors contributing to churn.  
2. **Predict churn**: Build predictive models to classify customers into low-risk and high-risk categories.  
3. **Enhance retention**: Implement and test tailored interventions to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Solution Approach  

### 1. Data Collection  
- Data sources:  
  - CRM systems for customer demographics and payment history.  
  - Usage analytics for engagement patterns.  
  - Customer feedback surveys for insights into dissatisfaction.  
- Data preprocessing: Handle missing values, outliers, and ensure data is ready for analysis.

### 2. Data Analysis  
- **Descriptive Analytics**: Identify trends and patterns in customer behavior.  
- **Predictive Modeling**:  
  - Use machine learning algorithms to predict churn likelihood.  
  - Evaluate models using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall.  
- **Customer Segmentation**: Group customers based on engagement, demographics, and churn risk.

### 3. Strategy Development  
- Personalized retention strategies, including:  
  - Discounts for at-risk customers.  
  - Tailored engagement campaigns (e.g., targeted emails, in-app messages).  
  - Improved onboarding processes to reduce churn during the early stages.  
- Pilot strategies with a test group and analyze effectiveness before full implementation.

### 4. Success Metrics  
Measure the impact of strategies using:  
- **Retention Rate**: Percentage of customers retained over a specific period.  
- **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**: Average revenue generated from a customer during their lifetime.  
- **Model Performance**: Reduction in churn prediction errors.
